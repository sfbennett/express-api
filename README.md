# Express API

A simple RESTful API that I created with Express for managing data from three different end points.

- Responses (to test the app's initial functionality)
- Animals
- Random Programming Facts (generated with each GET request/page refresh)

## API Endpoints

Get all animals

- URL: `/animals`
- Method: `GET`

Get a random programming fact

- URL: `/facts`
- Method: `GET`
